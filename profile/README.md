    <td>![communities](profile/communities.png)
     We offer a digital wallet that can only be accessed using your voice (biometrics). It allows you to identify yourself, register, store, and exchange information. 

In addition, through this wallet, you can request services without passwords, endless paperwork, or expensive devices.
